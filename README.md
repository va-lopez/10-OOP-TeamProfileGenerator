# 10-OOP-TeamProfileGenerator
Description
This application will generate an html document displaying all the employees in your team that you have entered in when prompted. This webpage will display your team's basic information for quick access. Using a command-line application, the user is able to enter in their team's personal information. 

When the application is run, the user will be prompted to enter in the managers information such as their name, id number, email address, and office number. Then, the user will be prompted to either add an Engineer/Intern or to not add any employees at all. If they select either an engineer or intern, the same information as the manager will be asked minus the office number. Both have a unique piece of information, for the engineer it is their github account and for the intern, their school name. 

When the engineer's information is displayed, you will be able to link to their github by clicking on their github username.

When any of the employees email address is selected, your defualt mail application will open up allowing you to quickly send them an email.
